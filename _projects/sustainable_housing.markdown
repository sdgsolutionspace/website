# Sustainable Housing Project

** by Benjamin Schmale **

Sustainability is arguable one of the greatest problems that humanity faces. The UN certainly thinks so, as evidenced by their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Sustainability is defined as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.
My project aims to solve some of these issues; by creating a self-sustaining house, I am addressing at least four of the SDGs. A house which is sustainable needs to be accessible to a good portion of citizens, needs to use clean, renewable energy and with long lasting, durable building materials. These four SDGs are: 
* N°7  (Affordable and Clean Energy)
* N°11 (Sustainable cities and communities)
* N°12  (Responsible consumption and production)
* N°13 (Climate Action)

I have several goals for this project; my primary goals, which include designing the house in a developing country, keeping it entirely off the grid, using sustainable and green energy and having an on-site pesticide free garden, and my secondary goals, which consist of making the house affordable, sourcing as many materials as possible locally and, finally, designing a house that will last for longer than the average in relation to the Life Cycle Analysis
My project has included a lot of research on sustainability, energy sources and the process of building and designing a house. At the end of the project, I will have produced a 3D model of a house and a full design brief which will show the details of the project. As a way of gauging my success, I will use the aforementioned Life Cycle Analysis to see the amount of time the house will last and to compare it to other houses of similar size.
