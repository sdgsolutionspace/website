## Hello readers!

{% include_relative test_module/README.md %}

**Featured from original post [by Emily Sheene](virtual_sdgsolutionspace)**

You’ve found yourself at the virtual SDG Solution Space, welcome! While this is a space we are all quite proud of and using as a home base to share about our projects, I thought it would also be cool if you could have a peek at what the brick and mortar SDG Solution Space looks like.

<br>
<br>
So, let me transport you to the place where the magic happens! The Solution Space is located in the Innovation Park building at the Biotech campus in Geneva. The Biotech campus is a joint initiative with a vision to “ensure that the Lake Geneva region and Switzerland as a whole remains at the cutting edge in the fields of biotechnology and life science research” (if you are interested more in the biotech campus, please visit [Campus Biotech](https://www.campusbiotech.ch/en) ). To enter the biotech buildings, you must have a badge. Yes, that’s right, someone at last has recognized our VIP status!

Ok moving on… the Solution Space is super cool and while disconnected from the other UNIGE buildings, this space feels like our own and is very comfortable and conductive to creative thinking. Attached to the Solution Space is a FabLab. Don’t know what a FabLab is? Head on over to [Fab Foundation](http://fabfoundation.org/index.php/what-is-a-fab-lab/index.html) to check it out!

No exaggerations with the comfort level here!

**Disclaimer:** I am not super techy, so sorry if I messed up a description here. But you get the point—there is a lot of cool equipment and it is all at our VIP fingertips. Thanks to Thomas Maillart and Jean-Marie Durney for providing the specs on the machines. By the way, we love having visitors, so if you haven’t checked out the SDG Solution Space yet (or even if you have), get in contact or just come on by! We hope to see you soon!
