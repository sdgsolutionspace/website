description: "Come discover the 3D object scan: We offer a series of workshops to help you discover:
- 3D scan technologies
- 3D reverse engineering
- 3D creation by digitalization
- The 3D scanner for the medical and para-medical world (prostheses / surgical guides / anatomical model etc ...)

This training is very useful for capturing complex shapes, taking inspiration from the elements around us to model them in 3D on a computer.

2 hours training accompanied by exercises adapted with the explanations of a specialist Pangloss."
