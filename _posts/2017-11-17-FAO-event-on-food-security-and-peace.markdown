Is there a link between conflict and food insecurity? To find answers to this question, a small group of interested students from our master programme attended the public event “No peace without food security. No food security without peace” on the 10.11.2017. The event was co-organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO and the United Nations. It explored how conflict-sensitive approaches to food security and nutrition can make a vital contribution to sustaining peace and preventing conflict. The conference focused on Colombia and its recent agreement to end conflict and build peace, with the so-called Comprehensive Rural Reform acting as one of the main pillars to foster the peace process in the country. Land was the origin of many armed conflict in Colombia, but land reform and restitution are now put at the heart of peacebuilding.

Ms. Ana Paula de la O Campos stressed the importance of moving beyond the emergency response way of doing peace. This means that the Colombian peace agreements need to go beyond the traditional themes of peace deals, such as disarmament and reintegration. It is also important to support the strengthening of government and civil societies. She also believes that it’s necessary to mobilize different actors, such as the private sector that plays an important role in employment generation and social cohesion.

H.E. Ms. Beatriz Londoño Soto presented the 6 major points of the peace agreement: 1) End of armed conflict 2) Justice for Victims 3) Rural Development t 4) Illicit Crop Substitution 5) Democracy 6) Verification. She explained that the Comprehensive Rural Reform is focused on the well-being of people in rural areas and mentioned how important it is to build trust and form genuine relationships between local, national and international actors.

Ms. Gordana Jerger explained that the number of people who are food insecure in conflict areas is far greater than the number of people dying as a direct result of violence. She then presented reports which displayed the linkages between conflict and food security, each can be a cause or result of the other.

Given this, we believe it is necessary to consider food security as key factor in the process of achieving peace. We find the link between food security and peace especially crucial in countries where agricultural and food production are key to economic and social development. As we learned in the conference, sustaining peace in Colombia depends on the government’s ability to move forward with land reforms and rural development. After all, a country where food security is not assured has very little chance of being peaceful.
