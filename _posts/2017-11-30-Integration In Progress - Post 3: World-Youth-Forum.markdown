To progress in our project with Women Refugees, it was interesting to go abroad and observe the means of integration that other actors
in a different county are using to integrate refugee women in their society.. For that reason, a member of our group travelled to Egypt
in Sharm El Sheik to attend a Youth Conference for Peace, where Young Leaders, NGOs, Diplomats and International Organization were
invited.

“The World Youth Forum is a free platform bringing youth from around the world together with decision makers and influential officials.
The forum is a chance for you to engage with top policy-makers in the region and network with promising youth from the region and the
world that are determined to create change in the world we live in today.”

The Forum was divided into pillars and the key topics that interested us were about the irregular migration, refugee crisis and
integration of women. According to the UNHCR, in 2017 Egypt was a hosting land for about 208’398 refugees and asylum seekers with
63 different nationalities, with a majority of Syrians. Therefore, solutions had to be created in order to integrate this population
into the Egyptian society. We believe that we can learn from their experience, solutions and use it as a model for our project.

We went to speak with different actors who gave us advice or agreed for a possible partnership. One organization inspired us for our
project. The National Council of Women shared their ideas with us about the ways to integrate “non-qualified” women into the society.
To resolve this issue, they said that their Organization is training women from different communities who have closeness to women
inside their circle. Then the trained women go door-to-door to inform the others of the possibilities they have. The Organization
said that this project was efficient because the women are keener to let enter someone from their community if they already had a contact with her previously.


Overall, this experience was enriching for our project in terms of partnerships and innovative ideas.
