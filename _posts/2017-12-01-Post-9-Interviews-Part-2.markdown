Hello everyone, here we are again! Interviews, Part 2.As you might remember from our last blog post, we are on a hunt to gather as much information from MHM expects in the field. As you’ve probably realized, our
aim is to identify what is the most useful MHM data to collect?

We got a chance to have a skip interview with Bernard Serunyigo, the director of Operations/Co-founder of Uganda 4 Her.  The organization aims at promoting
reproductive health, education, leadership, and economic empowerment. Check out their amazing wor here: http://uganda4her.org/.Our interview with Bernard was super insightful! He indicated that it would not
be useful to map products. However, it would be more useful to focus on mapping facilities. Luck for us, Sierra Lindsay (expert on MHM) joined our skyped
discussion. She indicated that you can buy products everywhere! Hence, the problem lies in overall affordability.She also insisted that we should focus on
mapping access to free products.



Our last interview was with Alexandra Geertz, the director of the FSG. The FSG is a consulting firm that works towards creating social change. Our interview with Alex was
super useful! We all started brainstorming our ideas together. She said she wasn’t entirely convinced that our idea would be implemented in “developed” regions”. She suggested that we can maybe focus on gender
disparities in the workplace.  For example, why not map the amount of restroom available in order to show a direct
link to gender disparities. Can you see a pattern? All of the people we’ve interviewed suggested that we find a link between data gathered and social
problem related to them. While they found our initial idea quite useful, they were able to provide us feedback on how we can improve our project. We
appreciate everyone feedback – so thank you for your insights!
