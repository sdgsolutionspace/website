During her lecture, the Professor focused on how to measure well being in a society by taking into account economic growth, 
social achievements and human development. The scope of this workshop was limited to the human development area.
 
According to Krishnakumar, human development is a multidimensional concept. Indeed, there are a lot of different factors that we can 
take into account to improve well being. However, the key lies in creating a correct environment for people to develop themselves and 
make their own choices among the available set of choices. In other words, the more choices you have in a society, the more you are 
developed. This means that in an ideal sustainable world, everyone would have equal opportunities no matter where they are born.  
 
However, this human development model has limitations. Indeed, to have statistical data of all countries, there is a need for 
consensus between all parties. Unfortunately, some indexes are too sensitive and some actors do not want these indicators to be public. 
In certain countries, political freedom or gender equality, for example, are very restrained. Therefore, the number of indexes that we 
have is very limited and can create some bias. We are however already seeing improvement in many countries. Practices and policies are s
lowly becoming more and more transparent, which allow for a more accurate index.
