Hi followers! Our apologies for leaving you hanging on the third post anxiously wondering how in the world we will collect data on access to MHM products and facilities. Today we will explain our ideas.

So, how will we collect and share this data? Drumroll, please….

Our idea is to create an open source map that would use crowdsourcing to map different dimensions related to MHM. We got some great inspiration for this project from SafeCity, a non-profit company with a platform that crowdsources personal stories of sexual harassment and abuse in public space. We’ve screenshot a picture of their map which you can find below, but we recommend you to check this site out (www.safecity.in) to get a better idea about their phenomenal work.

There are many things that can impede or facilitate access for people across the world. To refresh your memories, here are the aspects we are examining in regards to access:
1. Product Access:
Location of stores where products can be bought, cost, product types,quality of products, money distribution in family, distance from home/ school/ work
2. Facility Access:
Separate and private toilets, locking doors, clean water, soap, safe, waste disposal, distance from home/ school/ work

Our map would therefore include product access, facilities access but also a possibility to leave comments so that people can include some of their personal experiences with menstruation they’d like to share.

As you can see in image 2, after thinking about what is access and how a map would allow it, we brainstormed on the core value we believed our map should have; simplicity (the map should be fast and easy to use), inclusive (everyone should be able to use the map) and the map should be free to use.

This platform would be useful on three aspects; it would raise awareness on the issues women have to face and deal with every month, it would allow the collection of data on facilities and product access and last but not least, it would create a community where anyone would have the possibility to share their experiences and feelings related to menstruation, all of which would contribute to women’s empowerment, one of the main goals of this project. There are of course still some challenges and questions we still need to deal with in order to make this project successful, such as how to reach people who are illiterate, how to get people to start using the map and where to start setting up the map but we are confident that we will manage!

So there it is, now you know what our project actually consists of! The next blog post will be about the process of setting up this map so stay updated!

All our bleeding love,

The MHM Musketeers
