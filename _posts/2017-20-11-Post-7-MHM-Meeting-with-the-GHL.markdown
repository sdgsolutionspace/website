Hello everybody and here’s to another post! We got the chance to meet up with David and Adriana from the Global Humanitarian Lab (GHL). The team called us to their office with an exciting proposal: They want to use our topic for the Innovation Day in Geneva. The idea is to provide the participants with a question related to our topic for them to discuss, draw or model by using a toolbox. After some discussions with the enthusiastic GHL-team, we came up with the following question: “How to eliminate taboos around menstrual hygiene here in Geneva?” - we are looking forward to hear the results, what about you?

Lucky us, Tarun Sarwal (Head of Innovation at the ICRC) happened to be in the same room during our discussion. This was the chance for us to present our project idea! Mr Sarwal was impressed that we chose MHM as a project for the workshop and agrees on the importance of bringing menstruation into the spotlight. However, he was a bit sceptical about the feasibility of implementing our project on a global scale, especially within the timeframe of the workshop. Another concern of his was that none of us have a technical or IT background, which would definitely be needed to develop the platform. We believe this is a fair point but developing our own platform is not on top of our to do list as we plan to use existing tools for now. We appreciate every feedback - so, thank you Tarun Sarwal for your inputs!

And then (to our luck again) Olivier Delarue, CEO and co-founder of the GHL, spontaneously dropped by and, after hearing that we are working on a project on MHM, held an inspiring speech about the importance of addressing the topic of menstrual hygiene. Unfortunately (and not surprisingly) the topic is often not given any priority within many organizations - sometimes there is not even a budget allocated to MHM...

Curious about how we will take our project further? Do not miss our next blog post!

All our bleeding love,

The MHM Musketeers
