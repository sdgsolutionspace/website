Hello everybody and here’s to another blog post from the one and only MHM Musketeers! You must be curious about what we’ve been up to the last week, so let’s not waste any more time…

Before we tell you all about our very personal data collection experiences, we want to tell you how we even got there. As you’ve probably realized, the scale and scope of our project has been changing over time - the more discussions we’ve had and the more research we’ve done has gradually shifted our focus. This definitely keeps us on our toes and demands flexibility from all of us. Luckily, we are as determined to work on this project as in the beginning!

As you might remember from our last blog post, we got inspired by the website safecity.in to map product and facilities access of menstrual hygiene products. When we discussed this idea with our mentors from the workshop, we realized how important it is to start small and experience data mapping ourselves. One of our mentors Thomas Maillard really recommended to collect data in a specific neighbourhood in Geneva to not only collect our own information but also to understand how much time and energy is required to do the mapping. After all, our idea was to receive the data through crowdsourcing.

So, here’s our personal experiences of data collection in Geneva and Vienna.

Miriam’s experience collecting data in Geneva:

“Can I help you?” was probably the question I heard the most during my data collection in the Jonction and Cornavin neighbourhood in Geneva, followed by a puzzled look as to what I was doing there. I was not surprised though, standing there with my phone taking pictures of the products, scribbling down my findings on a notepad and literally getting down on my knees to count all the pads and tampons. To be fair, I felt a bit embarrassed and uncomfortable. Those emotions quickly changed to frustration and disbelief - how many products, brands, types of pads and tampons do actually exist! From always normal size, normal super plus, silk touch, pro comfort, dailies fresh, black and white to curved tampons, compak pearls and so on...do we really need all that?

Samsam’s and Miriam’s experience collecting data in Geneva:

On the following day, I was joined by Samsam to continue mapping the products in the Cornavin neighbourhood in Geneva. It’s definitely more fun together and so we happily went off and explored the stores around the train station. The initial high spirits already shifted to exhaustion after the second store with Samsam basically crawling on the floor counting all the products and Miriam’s hand cramping due to writing down all the details. After taking a few awkward selfies to capture the experience for this blog, we were quite relieved to finish our work....
Following Pascal’s presentation we also did a few mathematical calculations and visual representations of Global temperatures, HDI, the artic sea melt and the drivers of climate change. The graphs represented an increasing environmental impact through natural and human forces. 

Ludo’s experience collecting data in Vienna:

I started my collection of data with very high and motivated spirit, but to be honest this attitude shifted quite fast ;) I never ever had realized how many kind, size and type of menstrual hygiene could exist! Just to mention an example I spent 1h30 in the second shop I visited filling up my excel table. Plus the shop assistants were not so happy about my “awkward” presence for hours in front of their products and pretended some explanations (in German of course!).. well that’s the moment I became very creative ;).

In fact(17-November-2017) we’re going present our most important findings to our classmates and mentors. We will keep you posted!
 
All our bleeding love,
The MHM Musketeers
