The design thinking workshop was presented by Giorgio Pauletto, who works in Foresight Strategy, and Innovation. His main fields of interest and expertise are strategy, design thinking, lean approaches, digital transformation, and foresight methods. Design thinking is a combination of innovation, creativity and experimenting and according to Mr Pauletto, the process of creating a product from design thinking can be divided into five different parts: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.

In order to give us a practical idea of what this meant, we were asked to pair up and go through the following steps to create an innovative energy saving product for our partner depending on their needs. For each step, a certain amount of time was given to first talk about person a and then person b. The first step, the “empathy” step, was to casually talk with our partner about their lifestyle choices, especially their problematic energy consumption habits. The next step was to select one of the issues our partner raised and to define it by reframing it. In order to do so, a few small questions were asked as seen in image 1.

Following this, we had to generate five products that would solve our partner’s problem. Based on their feedback we then focused on designing one new solution. This new solution was then built with cardboard, paper, stickers and whatever was put at our disposal (shown in image 2). Even if these prototypes were not useable, it gave us an idea of the further thought process needed in order to design innovative products. This prototype was then showed to our partner in order to receive feedback (shown in image 3).

We personally really enjoyed the practical aspect of this workshop and after having asked some of our classmates, this seems to be the general opinion of the class. It gave us  an opportunity to get an idea of the complicated process of innovative product design. Some of the ideas generated were even highly recognized by the person who they were designed for and might even be used further. An example of this is the product created by Komal for Miriam. Miriam’s issue was the amount of time she spent in her shower while listening to music and consequently the amount of water she consumed. Therefore, Komal suggested an application that would only play a certain amount of songs, when the music stopped this would mean that Miriam would have to get out of the shower. There were few other ideas that were appreciated but a little more complicated to set up without the adequate background and tools. Such as the window which automatically closes or opens according to a schedule or with the help of an application on the inhabitants phone. This window was designed by Ludovica for Cassandre, to help her deal with her issue of wanting to have fresh air when she comes back into her room but not feeling comfortable leaving her window open all day since it cooled down the whole house and wasted heating energy. Some of the other prototypes can be seen in image 4. We (the authors) learned more about the process of this strategic problem-solving approach. This is very useful in helping us organize our ideas for our final SDG projects. This workshop encouraged us to look at problems from many different perspectives. We also learned about the importance of having a clear definition of the problem and the user, it’s all about how we understand their problem and how they can connect with the product in a personal way. Finally, the aspect of creativity in design thinking is really important for the application of our final SDG projects. Since “we can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them” Albert Einstein.
