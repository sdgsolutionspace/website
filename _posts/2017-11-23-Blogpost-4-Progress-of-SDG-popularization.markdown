Blogpost 4: Evaluating data - survey

In order to measure the impact of our video, we created a survey that would be answered by the viewers after watching the video. We were able to share the video and the survey to our friends and family through whatsapp. We received 31 responses. These responses can be beneficial in improving our project as we received useful feedback from people of different ages and regions.

The following question was asked in the survey:  Did you know about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) before watching the video?

67.7 % replied with a yes and 32.3 % replies with a no. This shows that 1 in 3 people were not aware of the SDGs. For the question ‘Have you found out more information about the extent of impact humans have on the Earth?’, 45.2 % people replies with a yes. This shows that the our entire objective wasn’t met. We aimed to create awareness about the existence of global issues and we were only able to achieve it partially. 

In terms of the open questions, we asked whether the participants found out anything that they weren’t aware of through the video. Most of the responses highlighted that the participants that the participants weren’t well aware about the extent of impacts humans have on the earth. A few responses mentioned the video clips about the meat production factories. This shows that the video clips were effective in garnering the public interest as the participants were able to recall the visuals.
 
67.7 % participants felt that the video was effective in informing about the SDGs being the solution to reduce environmental degradation, disparities and inequalities. This is useful as it means that there is definitely room for improvement. 

Suggestions for improvement:
- Explain what the SDGs are and what can be done and how?
- The video showcased the SDG but it lacked their actual applicability in real life for eg in an ordinary life context. Therefore, highlighting how the SDGs can be used to reducing global issues could be useful
- Statistics and data about human impacts on the earth
