A meaningful collaboration emerged recently between <b>Solution Space</b> and <b>Geek Girls Carrots Geneva</b>.
<a href="http://geekgirlscarrots.org/"><b>Geek Girls Carrots</b></a> is a global organisation aiming to create a community of women in IT.
The initiative wish to attract more women to technology and through regular meet-ups gives them the opportunity to share their knowledge and experience. The organisation is present already in 15 countries, mostly in Europe, but also Japan, South Korea, and Israel.

Given that <a href="https://twitter.com/sdgsolspace?lang=en"><b>Solution Space</b></a> is a place where innovators, change-makers and motivated people have a chance to meet and work together at the heart of international Geneva, we decided to open the door for these types of events and host the Geek Girls Carrots for the first time.
Being new in Geneva, Geek Girls Carrots aims to communicate more about their activities and reach women - but also men - that are keen to join this community of female admins, analysts, graphic designers, IT managers, programmers, social media specialists, system architects, project managers, women with start-up ideas, computer science students, and many more.

Why is it important to have more women in technology? Many reports show that women and men should substantively contribute and participate to <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/action/gender-equality/Pages/default.aspx"><i>ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies)</i></a>, although women are still underrepresented in this field.
Consequently, GGC tend to promote ICTs within a community of women in Geneva and is interested in fostering the prospective partnerships with other organisations.
<br>

The topic discussed during this meet-up, was the empowerment of young girls by providing free classes of programming and technology software. In order to implement this idea, Marija Musja gave a speech about her association called <a href="https://www.emplab.org/"><i>Empowerment Lab</i></a> and particularly the <i>“Creativity in Code”</i> project. In few words, the idea is how to promote self-directed learning online among young girls in developing countries.
In order to answer to this question, our guest speaker conducted a survey on 359 children (171 boys and 188 girls) aged from 13 to 16, and asked them what are their ambitions for the future. It was revealed that boys are more self-assured about their future dream jobs than girls, just because girls did not have an opportunity to realise their professional potential, because the society has other expectations from them. This means that the main gap between girls and boys in terms of professional ambitions appears approximately at the age of 15. Therefore, it is important to provide girls with free programming classes, not in order to force them to be web developers, but to give them a chance to develop their creative thinking. Maria’s project focuses mainly on reaching young girls in remote areas of Ukraine and providing them with free classes in order to empower those future generations. Asked <i>“- Why coding?”</i>, she simply answered:
<i>“- We live in the digital age. Without the knowledge and skills of digital technology, many people are left behind, unable to fulfil their potential in life. Girls are especially vulnerable to this as digital expertise is usually seen as the preserve of boys and men. Yet the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector continues to grow across the world and a shortage of specialists is a golden opportunity for girls everywhere.”</i>
<br>

However <i>“Creativity in Code”</i> project does not target exclusively girls in Ukraine. Thanks to genuine people, <a href="https://wemakeit.com/projects/creativity-in-code"><i>various workshops</i></a> are available to be attended also in Geneva by children and adults with a focus on women and girls.
Consequently, the lead thought is to empower all the girls of today around the world, in order to help them become the leaders of tomorrow.
