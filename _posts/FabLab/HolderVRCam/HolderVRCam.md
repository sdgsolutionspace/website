# Holder VR Cam

The purpose of this 3D design is to create a holder for the Camera of the VR System

For the VR system you need to set the space were the system will analyse your moves.
To do so you put 2 Square Cameras on tripod at two opposite corner of the volume you want to use.

ADDICLAB has a HTC vive VR system but if the system is coming with 2 cameras on support, those supports are not adapted to the screw of the Tripods.

and finally Jan use tie-rip to fix them on the tripods.

## Objectifs:

The idea is to create this missing part between the top screw of the tripop and the support of the camera.

*** pict screw & support


As the design is really simple, I am using Tinkercad.com to draw the part between the screw and the support.

With a simple Clic on the following link you should be able to visualize or/and  download STL which allow you to print the part.
