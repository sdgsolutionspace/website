Hello everyone, here we are again! So in order to find some inspirations on how to narrow down our project as suggested by both Mr. Sarwal and Mr. Delarue (see post 7) we decided to get in contact with some people that get their hands dirty with menstrual hygiene issues on the ground.

Basically our aim was to get a feedback on our idea from experts active in the MHM field and if possible, get some information on which data they felt would be the most useful to collect.

Our first skype interview was with Calum Smith, the director of operation of Irise International. Irise international is an organization working mostly in East Africa whose aim is to “generate the evidence base needed to inform the work of organisations working to support girls during their periods, and to complete the development of a model package which can be widely replicated.” You can have a look at their amazing initiative here: http://www.irise.org.uk/.
The interview with Mr. Smith has been super-duper useful! He told us that our project would be very needed for organizations such as Irise International. He mentioned that there is a strong need for open data and collaboration around the issue of MHM in order to develop a standardized procedures and indicators. He also insisted on keeping him updated with our developments and informed us about a very cool project called MH Map that maps NGOs and researchers in the field of MHM. It really deserves to be checked: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1Ev20i3vXiFCa1OEExovP4TSB4G4&ll=18.734973868845824%2C15.001396100000136&z=2

We also had the opportunity to interview Ina Jurga, the International Coordinator of Menstrual Hygiene Day of WASH United. MH Day, which takes place on the 28th of May, is an initiative to “raise awareness on the challenges that women and girls worldwide face due to their menstruation and to highlights solutions that address these challenges, including through media work.” If you are interested, and you should be, check this out: http://menstrualhygieneday.org/.
Irina was super kind and offered us the possibility of a potential opportunity to promote our future project during their Menstrual Hygiene Day event (not bad eihn?). She also stressed the fact that we should be able to show some correlation between the data that we collect and some social problem related to them (this point was also mentioned by Mr Smith during our skype call). 

Interviews are not yet over… we still have some “rendev-vous” with very interesting folks in the next few days! Keep in touch… 

All our bleeding love,

The MHM Muskeeters
