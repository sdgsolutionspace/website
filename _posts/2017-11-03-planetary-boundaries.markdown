The talk was given by Pascal Peduzzi who is the Director of GRID Geneva at the United Nations Environment Programme and one of his main areas of expertise is Planetary Boundaries. His presentation was very interesting as it connected very well with our Master’s programme in Innovation, HD and Sustainability which focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals, thus, it was very useful to understand the concept of Planetary Boundaries. 

In the lecture, Mr Peduzzi explained that Planetary Boundaries are a set of nine bio-physical limits of the Earth System that should be respected in order to maintain conditions favorable to further human development. Exceeding this threshold could result in drastic change in human societies by disrupting the environmental limits based upon our current socio-economic system.

Climate Change is a known global limit which is being addressed globally in the SDG 13 Climate Action whereby urgent action is required to combat climate change and its impact. Mr Peduzzi highlighted the nine bio-physical limits: Climate, Ocean Acidification, Ocean depletion, Global freshwater use, chemical pollution, land system change, biodiversity loss, biochemical loading B &P, atmospheric pollution - as shown in the image below.

The scenario looks rather grim, from science perspective, collective actions are urgently needed, what are the obstacles that prevent the implementation of radical measures that address the problem? Professor Jongen Randers, co-author of The Limit to Growth pointed out, ‘If I could persuade you of one thing, it should be this: the world is small and fragile, and humanity is huge, dangerous and powerful.” In an attempt to predicate the world 2052, he believed that the world will continue, more or less, in sad ways, building towards a climate crisis, and the reason is not a technological one. New technologies that can cut greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to avoid dangerous warming and they are not much more expensive than traditional technology, the root cause is how human society is organized and how decisions are made – shortsightedness in politics. Dr. Tao’s lecture began with Switzerland’s case of “Green economy” popular initiative, one that failed to a large majority of rejection. However, consumption impact of any developed country doesn't confine to national borders, nor does climate change effect, it is expected 90% of glacier in Switzerland will disappear by the end of 21 centuries. Dr Tao’s research is part of FOEN’s pilot study to assess the extent to which Switzerland's footprints are in line with the planetary boundaries, the study has shown that Switzerland's climate and biodiversity footprints and those relating to ocean acidification and the nitrogen cycle have reached a critical level. Unfortunately, before the critical level of chaos in developed societies – as a result of overexploitation of habitats dawns on them, neither the capitalist system nor democratic society appears to be willing to sacrifice short-term advantage in order to create a better life for the future.
