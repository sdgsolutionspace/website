Blogpost 5: Project Feedback
A Summary of the Post-Presentation Class-Discussion

The feedback we got on the video from the class after our presentation was quite positive, and the following discussion helped us a lot in terms of what the next steps can be. Even though our class is not necessarily the target audience, their feedback is valuable to us. We wanted constructive criticism regarding the understanding of the concept and the structure of the video and whether it made sense. (To read about the concept and structure of our video in detail, please go to Blogpost 2).

Generally, the audience liked the 2 different parts of the video. The video was split into shocking dramatic imagery without any text or explanation in order to create curiosity amongst the audience and evoke emotions with the help of dramatic music. And it was juxtaposed with positive imagery giving hope. These 2 parts were well understood by the audience according to their feedback. 

In comparison to already existing videos, it was also pointed out as a novelty of our video. The video isn’t over educational as we didn’t want it to come across as preachy. Instead, the lacking information is justified by giving views space and time to think about the shocking imagery and possible solutions to these problems. Also the transition from the negative to the optimistic part of the video was perceived as smooth and the introduction of the SDGs as the solution, has been understood.
 
The main area of improvement lies in the optimistic- or ‘Hope’ part. This is also the trickiest part, as there is a fine line between giving hope, motivating people to learn more about the SDGs, or causing the feeling that things are already being done, others are helping so I don’t need to. We wanted to avoid the latter. Unfortunately, this was not so clearly achieved, according to the class’ feedback. 

A possible solution for improvement of the ‘Hope’ part could be, to pick up the idea of the first part again using people’s faces, and show how people like you and me can work towards the SDGs. Therefore, we want to use people from different origins and backgrounds and show their story of progressing towards achieving the SDGs. For example, for China, we would show or interview a Chinese student working on a SDG related project, that has a direct link and relevance to existing problems in China. This would as well add to the originality and authenticity of the video.
 
Suggestions for further improvements and possible next steps have been made by the class and are summarized here below. We split them into the following two categories.
 
1. Adjustments to be made to the video:

Make the message of the ‘Hope’ part more clear, motivate people more (for example by stories of  people of different origins and mother tongues, working on projects towards the SDGs, as mentioned above).
Improve the overall quality of the video (use better camera, sound recording, higher resolution images, more professional video editing program such as Adobe for example)
Adjust or translate the SDG logo to the different language regions
 
2. Steps to be taken in terms of video distribution:
 
Find an adequate way to provide more information about the SDGs after the viewer has seen the video (whether or not to create our own platform, refer to the SDG homepage, or even to create an interactive video, where people can upload their own SDG related videos into our existing frame, or to create a chain mechanism, that people are uploading their own SDG contribution videos to our platform)
Define which languages the video should be translated into.
Research and analyze which sharing platform to use for distribution in the respective regions.
