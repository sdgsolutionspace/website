Today we had the great opportunity to be given a lecture by Jonathan Normand, the founder and executive director of B-Lab Switzerland. B Lab Switzerland is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to facilitate companies to incorporate social and environmental missions in their operations. Basically, it serves a global movement of people using business as a force of good. The link of this company is: https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/about-b-lab

Located in 5 continents in Europe, since 4 years ago, B-Lab aims to create a “Community of Certified B Corporations” that voluntarily commit themselves to apply some verified higher standards of transparency, accountability, and performance. The idea behind the project is, on the one hand to rewards companies that are driving the change for a better world and on the other to inspire other companies to do the same. 

They aim at creating a business cultural shift. You can have an idea of their mission by having a look at this video: “THE CHANGE OF THE WORLD” B CORP 2007-2017. The biggest idea of B Lab is to achieve their dream that “One day, all companies will compete not only the best IN the world, but the best FOR the world”, as they mentioned in that video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-VFZUFJwt4

Today, B corporation has influenced 2260+ companies in 50 countries, covering 130 industries in total. This great scale has generated 144,858 employees in B corps, with 31 billion US dollars as revenue per year. 

According to BBMG “73% of consumers care about the company, not just the product when making a purchasing decision”. For this reason, one of the specificity of the B-Corp Certification is that it goes beyond a product based-certification such as energy star, FSC or fair-trade labels. It is in fact a holistic certification that applies for the company as a whole. As mentioned before, as now, there are around 2263 Certified B Corps spread in 50 different countries. This is a clear sign that companies are reacting from the fact that people are increasingly demanding better from them. 

The speaker criticized companies that are making too much margin revenue without doing the matched scale of good things for the society. As an example for this assumption he compared the FAIRPhone company that makes 15% margin on their phones, with Apple which has 58% of margin. But is that the problem of how much margin the company achieve? Maybe not, the fundamental problem is how the companies are contributing or caring about the whole world with its revenue. High margin is not wrong in the business world, it helps the company to keep growing with higher impact. If the companies can do more good for the world with its big margin, their impact will make the world change, into a better direction.

The presentation was very interesting, inspiring and motivating, however it also gave us the opportunity to think about the future of the business and to questions the direction in which we are going. Of course it would be great if every firm and company would follow some environmental and social standards to regulate its operations, however these standards would still serve to their economic growth… Some questions arise thus almost automatically:  is economic growth the right way? Do we perhaps need to readapt all the system? Can we really afford to continue growing even when this growth meets the highest standards?
