Since our group project is dealing with the plastic food containers’ pollution in China, which has strong connection with the waste management system in Chinese context, we had this interest to know more about the Smart Trash project conducted in SDG Summer School. Thanks to the introduction given by Gregory, David, Thomas and François, we fortunately got the chance to meet one of the students that project: Carole Grange from the University of Geneva. 

From the SDG in Progress platform, we can have a basic idea of the Smart Trash project: during the 8 weeks in the summer school, the two girls, Carole Grange from University of Geneva and Weiyi Qiu from the University of Tsinghua as a team, spent most of time in the Solution Space, Geneva, but also several weeks in New York, visiting the local projects and SIMS Recycling Centre US, Beijing, visiting and delivering presentations in respectively in Beijing, and Shenzhen.

The SMART Trash project aims to create an education platform to learn about global recycling infrastructures in China and the environmental, social and economic benefits of recycling and a trash classification scanner to introduce Chinese schoolchildren into recycling from a different perspective. The project integrates open-source technologies to provide an interactive educational experience.

In the meeting with Carole, she explained with details on how they did in each step. And we have the resonate with Carole on the difficulty to identify the scope of the project. She mentioned they were keeping changing ideas and directions during the first several weeks, and after some visit and meetings with the local practitioners in New York, they became more and more clear on what to produce for the whole project. 

Their presentations in Beijing and Shenzhen proves to be big success, children and local communities are very interested in their SMART Trash Bin idea, and they finished their final design and even have a prototype which is made of paper.

We appreciated a lot for Carole’s introduction on their work, and her kind sharing on all the contact information which is related to our project, including the ongoing research project from the Center for Urban Science and Progress in the University of New York, Weiyi Qiu-the other student in this project, teacher in the Innovation lab of University of Tsinghua, and etc. 

These information values a lot for our project and more collaboration opportunities could be digged out in the future.
