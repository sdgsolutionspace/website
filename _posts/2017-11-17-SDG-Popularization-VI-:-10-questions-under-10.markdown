Blogpost 6: 10 questions under 10

We decided to keep our original ‘Are you okay?’ video and maybe slightly edit it out. However, we decided to create a new series of videos inspired by ‘73 questions with Vogue’.

We wanted to create a series of short 2 minutes videos following around a few people while we asked questions about the SDGs and how they were involved in achieving them. As our target audience is the public unaware of the SDGs, we wanted the participants to be from different walks of life to provide varied responses. These guests could range from students to teachers to university lecturers, UN workers or even the local Geneva public. We also had the idea of filming the videos in different languages in order to show a global approach and perspective. 

We created a list of potential participants for our video series:

Francois Grey - GTI project manager - english
Michael Moller - Director general of UN Nations Office at Geneva 
Kali Taylor - IISD
Oday Darwich - arabic
Farmer at Meiner - french
Miya - IHDS student - Chinese
Marlyne Sahakian - lecturer at UNIGE - english/french
Mahenau Agha - Head of outreach at UNEP inquiry - english

We are considering sending emails to these people and asking whether they would be willing to participate in our video series.
