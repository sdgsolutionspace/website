For the IHDS workshop, we are doing a project on soil fertility in urban, peri-urban and agricultural areas. We are happy to say that we have encountered a lot of enthusiasm from every actor contacted for this project. We named our project Crowdsoil, because the app we are creating will generate a useful database related to soil quality and fertility for decision-makers.
In order to know how to evaluate the quality of the soil, we met with Benjamin Reichlin (HEPIA), Nicolas Courtois (AgriGenève) and a few local farmers. They were all interested in how to practice a healthier agriculture – without plowing their crops. Plowing has been around for decades and is harmful to the soil. As the machine tears into the ground, it exposes the soil to rain, wind and sun. Each year, 24 billion tons of the world's soil blows or washes away, largely because of plowing.

During this beautiful sunny morning, we examined about 5 parcels from different crops, each time doing 3 or 4 tests at different places on the parcel. The test we did is called the “spade test”. Many characteristics of a soil can be determined such as horizons or layers, texture, colour, odour, structure, roots and soil dwelling animals. With this test, you can see the effect of soil tillage. The test can help the farmer grade its soil on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the best quality. Precise grading criteria can be found on the image below.

Nicolas Courtois, from AgriGenève, is trying to promote the direct seeding method under vegetative cover. With this method, no tilling or plowing is required. During the activity, we learned a lot about the first step in evaluating one’s soil. We also met very interesting people who were willing to help with our project and to provide us with all the information we needed.

And to top it off, we were offered a special “apéro”, with excellent wine from Yvan’s vineyard!
