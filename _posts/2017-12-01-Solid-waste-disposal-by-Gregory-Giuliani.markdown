Blog Post on the Workshop on Citizen sensing of solid waste disposals: crowdsourcing as tool supporting waste management in a developing country by Gregory Giuliani 

Solid Waste Management (SWM) is a global environmental issue, which is still unsolved in many parts of the world. The mismanagement of solid waste is caused by many different factors including an increasing population, rapid urbanization, inequalities, economic growth and lack of adequate policies and governance. And it is an important issue to solve as it results 	in the proliferation of uncontrolled landfills, causing environmental and human risks. There is therefore an urgent need to put into place a sustainable SWM system!

Tons of solid waste are being carelessly thrown out on streets and land everyday around the world (see image 1), which is why there is a need for a system that would collect and deposit the waste in controlled landfills. However the main reason such systems can’t be put into place is because there is a lack of data concerning the location of where most of the waste is. In order to help resolve the environmental problems that the city of Kinshasa is facing due to the lack of SWM, the University of Kinshasa, the National Pedagogical University and the University of Geneva have collaborated to put into place a crowdsourcing platform to collect data on solid waste disposals.  In order for the information collected to be as useful and relevant as possible the users of the platform are asked to fill in the fields seen in image 2. In addition to this images, videos and links may also be added when submitting data.

Anyone can submit data and they have the option to submit their data through the Ushahidi mobile phone app, send an email or send a tweet. However, in order to make sure that the data is of sufficient quality the data uploaded is reviewed, corrected and verified. 

The crowdsourced data can be seen through the following link: http://kinmap.grid.unep.ch

The data collected through the app is shown via a spatial and temporal distribution in an interactive map. Users are also able to download reports in Comma Separated Values (CSV) or Keyhole Markup language (KML) for further analysis in applications such as GIS. Crowdsourcing has been a valuable mechanism to involve citizens in collecting data about solid waste landfills. These contributions fill in information gaps allowing authorities to gain information about environmental problems. A heatmap uses Kernel Density Estimate to generate density maps. It shows hotspots and clusters to mark high concentration activity. 
The current database in Kinshasa is 61 public disposals, 151 wild dumps, including 174 active and 3 inactive disposals all of which accounts for a total of 587, 920 m³ of solid waste.

This new method of data collection allows information to be on disposal which wasn’t possible before. The participation and commitment by local communities has been essential for this project therefore, finding tools that were easy to use by non-specialists for documentation the main aim.

Crowdsourcing is proving to be a valuable and innovating tool for collecting data on solid waste landfills while getting the public involved. The public has been able to create a detailed database and map of Kinshasa which didn’t exist before. This provides data for local authorities to take action against waste. The main challenge is the sufficiency of data quality. Crowdsourcing is proving to be a new innovative method to resolve issues on a local level while involving the citizens. As the local citizens experience the real life issues, they are able to contribute and make a difference in the area they live in. In terms of challenges, it is essential to keep the citizens motivated to maintain their participation and keep adding new information and to get more people involved.

We (the authors) believe that this workshop was very useful for us and the class context, as Kinshasa has set an example of using a low budget, low maintenance program that requires the least technological knowledge to create a change in the community. In addition to this, the method for crowdsourcing allows the community to be involved in the process and make a difference. We believe the same idea of using basic technology and locals can be replicated and used in many different contexts and other countries, including to solve other important issues mentioned in the 2030 Agenda.
