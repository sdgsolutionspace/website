Welcome readers. If you’re still following along with us MHM Musketeers, bravo! We have an important update for you. So we’ve had a slight shift in our project idea. Let us fill you in.

Once upon a time there was a group of six naive MHM Musketeers who spent all their time and many many hours researching MHM and forming a project that would aide to the improvement of MHM for women the world over. They traversed many countries and peoples (albeit virtually) to gain expertise and perfect a project idea before their time to do so ran out (otherwise known as the end of their first semester). While they thought their idea was quite solid, they found even more ways in which to improve it.

As you’ve already seen, the MHM Musketeers went to the land of Skype to talk with many people. After these discussions, they decided to limit their scope a bit and focus primarily on mapping facilities (leaving out products). One afternoon, they met with a wizard named Thomas, who helped them think outside of the box. How would they incentivize the crowd to get involved with the project and to actually map things instead of throw tomatoes? They started brainstorming all together and once again came back the previously mentioned idea of incorporating a rating system (thanks Thomas for this idea!). They would rate spaces and those who were certified could receive a certified status and sticker.

That, dear readers, is how they came to the idea of Fem.Friendly. By mapping toilets and eventually additional dimensions, and rating each space based on how equipped they are to facilitate women through menstruation (are there trash bins for used products? Is there soap? Is there privacy?) they could see how female friendly spaces are.

Ok, storytime over. So back to reality-- now we are moving full force with fem.friendly! It’s very exciting. We are currently in the creation phase, which you will hear more about in our next post, and have been busy pitching our project idea to the Director-General of the UN office at Geneva-NBD.

That’s right! We said presenting our idea to Michael Møller! How cool? Mr. Møller was visiting the Solution Space when we got to present our idea to him yesterday.

Yay for getting to explain our project to cool people! So where will we go from here? We will continue building the Fem.Friendly brand by working on our website, making the data collecting survey and Fem.Friendly stickers, collecting data and contacting potential Fem.Friendly certified businesses. Wish us luck!

Happily ever after and of course with all our bleeding love,

The MHM Musketeers
