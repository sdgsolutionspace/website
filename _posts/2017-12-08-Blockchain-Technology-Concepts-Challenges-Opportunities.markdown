On the 30th of November, Jean-Henry Morin, a professor at the University of Geneva focusing on information systems and services, gave a fascinating presentation on blockchain technology. Explaining this topic to students who have no or very little background in IT surely wasn’t an easy task. However, with his obvious passion for the subject and a good portion of humour professor Morin managed to make us all a little bit wiser on the topic.

So, let’s start right at the beginning. Blockchain is a software platform which stores information across a network of people, making it decentralized and distributed. This means that no one owns or controls the system, but everyone can use it and help run it - and this is a great advantage as it is incredibly difficult for an individual to take down the network or corrupt it. Hence, information can be safely stored and forwarded to others.

Clearly, and in technical terms, there is much more to blockchain. The following three concepts are the most important to (try to) understand the technical background of blockchain:
-	Digital signatures: A digital signature is a mathematical scheme used to demonstrate the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. Anyone can generate a digital name and digital signature on blockchain.
-	Hash functions: A hash function is mathematical process that transforms input data (simple words or whole texts of any size) into output data (a code including numbers and letters of a fixed size). A tiny change to the input produces a completely different output. In simpler terms, hash functions can be compared with book call numbers in a library: each book has a unique number and can easily be found with it.
-	Asymmetric cryptography: For asymmetric cryptography (writing or solving codes) two keys are used: a private and a public one. Anyone will be able to encrypt a message (convert information into a code) using the public key, but only the private key will allow you to decrypt (decode or decipher information) the message. Like this, it is possible to exchange confidential messages with a trusted and authenticated origin. The following graph clearly demonstrates how asymmetric cryptography works.

The top three popular Blockchain platforms are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyper ledger. The main difference between bitcoin and credit cards, PayPal or other ways of sending money, is that there are no middlemen involved (who takes a portion of your money!). Instead people from all over the world validate the bitcoins transactions from their own personal computer, earning a small fee in the process.

So how is blockchain useful for the future? In his presentation, Professor Morin advised us to have a look at a TED Talk called “How the blockchain is changing money and business” by Don Tapscott. He believes that the financial service industry is something that takes overly complicated measures to perform simple tasks. If it were to be replaced by a blockchain financial industry, things would be a lot easier.

What’s more, in today's world it is unfortunately easy for powerful people to take land that isn’t theirs. But by putting land titles on a blockchain, these would be immutable and therefore no chance for corruption. Uber, Airbnb, Lyft and so on are companies who pride themselves in being part of the sharing economy. However, the wealth gained from these services could be shared a lot better if the platforms themselves didn’t take such a significant amount of money for every transfer. Without intermediary’s money transfers would go directly from the consumer to the person providing the service.

We all create digital data ourselves when we connect to the internet. Only this information is not owned by ourselves. With blockchain, companies could create an identity in a black box, our virtual selves owned by ourselves. Wherever we go, this black box would only share the minimum required information about us. This could help us protect our privacy which is important as it is the foundation of a free society.

To resume blockchain can create prosperity, reduce social inequalities and redistribute wealth more fairly, all of which are very important to reach the Agenda 2030.

During the Q&A session, students raised many interesting questions about his technology and its application, a big message needs to be proposed here is: Blockchain is not a database, so your content of your transactions can never be available in that network, only the transactions themselves!

We appreciated this informative presentation given by professor Morin. Blockchain is said to be one of the most revolutionary innovations of today, which is why we believe it is very important to (at least partly) understand it.
