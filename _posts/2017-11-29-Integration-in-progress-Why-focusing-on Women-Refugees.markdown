Integration in Progress - Why Focusing on Women Refugees?


The specific context of Geneva in the refugee “crisis”:


Firstly, the following are some statistics which bring a good understanding of the local situation in Geneva, regarding the number of refugees that are requesting for an asylum seeking status  in the Canton of Geneva.

According to the Office Cantonal de la Statistique, in 2015, 7’586 people were involved in the asylum procedure in the Canton of Geneva, among which 2’151 people were asylum seekers with a permit N, 2’094 people with a permit F and 2’362 people were recognized as refugees with a permit B or C. Finally, 979 people were denied of their request, however they were given support to return to their country of origin.

Furthermore, nationalities that are the most represented in Switzerland and in Geneva are the following : Eritrea (539), Afghanistan (393), Syria (242), Irak (180), Sri Lanka (97), Somalia (65) et Nigeria (61).

Adopting a Gender Perspective:

In the context of the refugee crisis, it is crucial to understand the concept of gender equality and to consider the different needs, resources and safety concerns associated with refugee women. According to the UNHCR, the most vulnerable people in displacement situations are single women, pregnant women, head of household women, elderly women and disabled women. Two-thirds of refugees that migrate to Europe are men, thus the policies mostly overlook the needs of refugee women even though they play a key role in building the society.   

They are subject to multiple forms of discriminations such as persecuted because of their gender, sexual harassment and sexual violence and labour segregation. These are issues that women in some societies face every day, simply because of their gender however in the process of migration or displacement the issues are amplified. Thus, women should be provided with distinct asylum procedures and support, in order to be most effective at every step of the integration process in the new environment.

After conducting different interviews on the field with professionals directly associated with refugee procedures and programmes, we have noticed that there might be a lack of gender-sensitive care and measures guiding the asylum procedures in Geneva and Lausanne.
Following the interviews and discussions, we have decided to focus on women refugees because they are facing different types of discrimination and are more at risk than men to be victims of persecution.

Moreover, it is important to mention that empowering women can result in better and improved societies. They are crucial actors who financially support their families, protect and secure education for their children and are care-takers for the family and communities. Their role is not just limited to how society traditionally regards them as just daughter's, wife’s and mother’s. Thus, empowering women refugee and providing them with guidance and support will potentially result in their integration in a new society.

All these factors compel us to address the challenges faced by women refugee in order to facilitate and maximize their integration in the context of Geneva. This project will allow us to explore the relevance of gender equality within the refugee integration process while assessing the situation at a local level.

We invite you to read our next blog post, which will give you an insight of our findings and the solution we propose.
