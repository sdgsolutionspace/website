In order to continue with our <i>feuilleton</i> on our project called <b>Integration in Progress</b>, we decided to report this time on our participation to a hackathon. Well yes, some of the members of our team went to a hackathon on gender equality, which took place in November at the <a href="https://www.thinktankhubgeneva.org/sdgaccelerator">Impact Hub in Geneva</a>. 

First things first, some of you may not be familiar with the term <i>hackathon</i>. A hackathon is an event where coders, designers, and business people come together with the aim to create a product over a weekend. Generally, there are not many ways to "prepare" for a hackathon and that is probably the most exciting part of it: no framework, no requirements for innovative projects, just a limit of time, varying between two and three days. Hackathons were initially designed for software engineers working together in order to develop a new innovative solution with coding, graphics and interface design.
However this time, with a gender hackathon it was slightly different and that was the beauty of this event. It was organised by <a href="http://www.foraus.ch/#!/en/about-foraus"><i>Foraus</i></a> - the Swiss Forum on Foreign Policy - in collaboration with the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Think Tank Hub. There were about 12 challenges all focused on gender issues and the goal was to come up with an innovative solution (why not a new policy) in order to improve inequalities between women and men, mostly in the workforce, but not only.

Different actors such as private companies, public institutions but also associations, NGOs, and international organisations provided the challenges referring to concrete problems that those institutions are facing. As students of a master in <a href="http://gt-initiative.org/en/index.html#master"><i>Innovation, Human development and Sustainability</i></a> and young women having academic interests in gender equality, participating to this event was an incredible and unique experience. 
<br>
<br>
The outcome of the two days of intensive work with little to no sleep exceeded all expectations. Working in small groups of 4 to 7 people, mostly women with different professional qualifications and culture background were already a challenge in itself. The interdisciplinary background of participants showed us that the new inclusive approach to invite private-public collaboration to work on designing a policy is definitely not the easiest way to achieve things, although once an agreement is consensual within a group, the results are often extremely rewarding and satisfying. In this sense, diversity worked for us as leverage for innovation. 
<br>
<br>
Consequently, we were thinking about using this methodology – which is a hackathon - in order to solve our challenge, or rather challenges faced by organisations working with refugees in Geneva and especially refugee women. As our project focuses on how to implement the SDGs and how to measure the impact of the implementation, we believe that organising a hackathon can improve the partnership between many different organisations working on refugee issues. What we could observe through various interviews we conducted in November is that organisations think working in the same direction, although it is not a case. Asking professionals and experts from the field, how to improve the situation, we noticed that some organisations mentioned having too many volunteers and not knowing how to manage them, and others complained about the lack of motivated people that could help for free.
Therefore, we assumed that there is a lack of communication but not only. In this way, a hackathon can be a space for the development of new tools and innovations tackling the sustainable development challenges and for our project it can be a solution to improve the integration process of refugees in Geneva, which mainly address the gender equality <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg5">(SDG5)</a> and improvement of partnership <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17">(SDG17)</a>. Bringing various actors together, and putting them in contact in an interactive but at the same time indirect way, could help answering concretely to the challenges that seem impossible for some and ridiculously easy for the others.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, a gender hackathon proved not only being a fabulous personal experience, but also a very useful tool to tackle problems linked to the implementation of the sustainable development goals.
<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,
