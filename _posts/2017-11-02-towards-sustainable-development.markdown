Our first lecture of the course began with a presentation on the morning of October 5th by the esteemed Professor Pascal Peduzzi. Pascal serves as the Director of GRID-Geneva at the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). He Holds a PhD and a MSc in Environmental Sciences with specialization in remote sensing and GIS. Additionally, Pascal is a Professor at the University of Geneva in the Department of Geography & Environment and at the institute of Environmental Sciences. He did a great job of presenting us with some complex material in an easy to understand manner and his presentation was followed with a hands on practical exercise. 

The first part of the presentation offered students an insight into Grid Geneva and where it falls under the UN umbrella. GRID-Geneva was created by UNEP in 1985 and since 1998 it has been a partnership between UNEP, the University of Geneva and the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment. GRID-Geneva’s main role is to transform data into environmental information and knowledge to move toward sustainable development.

So let’s just jump in, here’s what we learned! 

There are numerous available methods of expertise that can be used to collect and analyze data both locally and globally. These include modelling, database, interactive maps and graphs, SDI, remote sensing, GIS, web data platforms, programming and capacity building. The Landsat Program has been especially useful in allowing us to see changes over time since its installation in 1972. Landsat images can be used to monitor forest fires, mining impacts, desiccation of water sources, deforestation and built land over time. Currently, we know that approximately 6.5 % of the Swiss land surface is built and this is increasing every year. This creation of cities and urban areas led to a major shift in human behaviour. 

With Eurasia falling under certain latitudes, it has allowed greater opportunities in terms of agriculture and cattle production. This allowed some empires to flourish such as the rice, cotton and tea productions in terms of trade. Furthermore, industrialization brought a shift in the mode of production and improvement in standards of living such as wealth, health and assets but it also accelerated environmental impacts. 

Global changes:
1)	Systemic eg climate change, CFCs
2)	Cumulative eg overfishing, deforestation

IPAT equation – by Ehrlich and Holdren measures the impact of humans on the environment

There is an unequal share of wealth in the world for instance Europe and North American account for 60 % of the worlds wealth. 

Rising interest towards sustainability from the 70s to now:

Following Pascal’s presentation we also did a few mathematical calculations and visual representations of Global temperatures, HDI, the artic sea melt and the drivers of climate change. The graphs represented an increasing environmental impact through natural and human forces. 

A big thanks to Professor Pascal Peduzzi for this interesting and informative lecture!
