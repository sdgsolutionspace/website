Blogpost 6: 10 questions under 10

As explained in blogpost 5, the feedback from the ‘Are you okay?’ video suggested that the audience understood the extent of human impact on Earth but that the video lacked an explanation about the SDGs and how they can be used. We wanted to make use of the feedback which is why we decided to highlight the ways in which people can get involved to work towards the SDGs despite their different backgrounds and knowledge.

We decided to keep our original ‘Are you okay?’ video and maybe slightly edit it out. However, we decided to create a new series of videos inspired by ‘73 questions with Vogue’.

We really enjoy watching these videos due to their nature of being very casual, informal and inviting. We wanted to the use the idea of Vogue of a follow around video but adding a twist to it whereby asking the interviewee about their involvement towards the SDGs. We wanted to create a series of short 2 minutes videos following around a few people while we asked questions about the SDGs and how they were involved in achieving them. As our target audience is the public unaware of the SDGs, we wanted the participants to be from different walks of life to provide varied responses. These guests could range from students to teachers to university lecturers, UN workers or even the local Geneva public. We also had the idea of filming the videos in different languages in order to show a global approach and perspective. 

These videos are intended to be like a casual conversation between the interviewee and the audience and no one but the interviewee is visible on screen. The nature of the video series as a one-shot follow around intends to be inclusive of the audience where they feel welcome.

We created a list of potential participants for our video series:

Francois Grey - GTI project manager - english
Michael Moller - Director general of UN Nations Office at Geneva 
Kali Taylor - IISD
Oday Darwich - arabic
Farmer at Meiner - french
Miya - IHDS student - Chinese
Marlyne Sahakian - lecturer at UNIGE - english/french
Mahenau Agha - Head of outreach at UNEP inquiry - english

We are considering sending emails to these people and asking whether they would be willing to participate in our video series.
