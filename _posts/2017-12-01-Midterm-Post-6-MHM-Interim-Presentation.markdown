Hello MHM groupees! We are checking in to update you on the midterm presentation of our project that took place on the afternoon of November 17th in the SDG Solution Space. We first introduced our project idea (if you don’t know about it, go check out our previous post number 4), reiterated why such a project is important, talked about who could use the collected data and discussed the current status and challenges we are facing with moving our project forward. Since we have already given you guys most of the details in previous posts, here we will only summarize the feedback we received from the audience and how we envision our project progressing after this point.

Our project idea sparked quite some interest and stirred up discussions. Yipee, one step closer to breaking the silence on menstruation! Here are some of the responses we got:

The feedback from our peers was valuable and made us reflect once again on the strong points and weaknesses of our project. Being critical is important - so here are the main issues we have to reconsider: the scale and scope of our project (yes we know, our focus is too broad), the data to collect (are product and facility access really the most relevant?), incentives for crowdsourcing and specifically how MHM data mapping will be useful.

We’re quickly approaching the end of this semester, so where do we go from here? We will continue to test Kobo Toolbox, think about incentives for crowdsourcing, contact experts  to discuss our project and get their input on what data they think is most important to collect.

Alas, after hearing some concerns and future plans, won’t you please oblige us to brag a bit? We are thrilled to continuously get such positive feedback about our topic choice! There is an agreed consensus on the strong need to find solutions and that MHM is a problem worth investing time into solving. We have been commended for our bravery on the topic although for us, we believe it is not a matter of bravery, but of doing what is right (and long overdue) for girls and women everywhere. Won’t you join us in this mission? If you have any comments, ideas or suggestions in regards to this project please get in touch with us!

Until next time.

All our bleeding love,

The MHM Musketeers
